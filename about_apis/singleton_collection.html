<h3>Singleton v. Collection Resources</h3>
<p>
A singleton resource is a single chunk of information, similar to a row in a database table. A collection resource is a set of resources with the same structure, similar to a selection of rows in a database table. Applications process singleton and collection resources differently. For example, applications can apply paging and filtering techniques to collection resources, but not to singleton resources. Another difference is that some HTTP operations  are not allowed on collection resources.
