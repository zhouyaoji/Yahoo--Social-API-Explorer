1. Copy these files to a directory on your Web server.

2. Go to https://developer.apps.yahoo.com/dashboard/createKey.html and
   create an OAuth application.
 
3. Copy the API Key, Shared Secret and App ID into the keys.inc file.

4. Point your browser to yahoo_social_api_explorer.php. 

5. Click on any of the links to make HTTP GET calls to the Y! Social APIs.

Note: Calls to the individual resources require IDs, which you can get from the
      the returned responses. For example, you can click on the Updates API link
      to get a response containing updates, with each update having an ID. You can 
      then enter the endpoint /v1/user/update/{ID} to get a single resource. 

      Most of the Social APIs have collection and single resource endpoints. See
      the Yahoo! Social API Reference for more information at http://developer.yahoo.com/social/rest_api_guide.
